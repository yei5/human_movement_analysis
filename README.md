## Project Intro/Objective
The purpose of this project is to develop a tool that can analyze human movement in real time and automatically classify specific actions such as walking, turning, sitting, and standing up.
Using MediaPipe Pose for landmark detection, the system will extract numerical features (angles, inclinations, velocities) and feed them into a supervised learning model (SVM, Random Forest, or XGBoost).
The project aims to support applications in health monitoring, workplace safety, and posture assessment through an accessible and interpretable AI solution.

### Methods Used
* Data Collection and Annotation
* Feature Extraction from Pose Landmarks
* Machine Learning (SVM, Random Forest, XGBoost)
* Data Preprocessing and Normalization
* Model Evaluation (Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-score)
* Data Visualization (Confusion Matrices, ROC Curves)

### Technologies
* Python
* Github

## Project Description
(Provide a more detailed overview of the project.  Talk a bit about your data sources and what questions and hypotheses you are exploring. What specific data analysis/visualization and modeling work are you using to solve the problem? What blockers and challenges are you facing?  Feel free to number or bullet point things here)

## Getting Started
Instructions for contributors
1. Clone this repo (for help see this [tutorial](https://help.github.com/articles/cloning-a-repository/)).
2. Raw Data is being kept [here](Repo folder containing raw data) within this repo.

    *If using offline data mention that and how contributors may obtain the data )*
    
3. Data processing/transformation scripts are being kept [here](Repo folder containing data processing scripts/notebooks)
4. etc...

*If your project is well underway and setup is fairly complicated (ie. requires installation of many packages) create another "setup.md" file and link to it here*  

5. Follow setup [instructions](Link to file)
